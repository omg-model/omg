The production and remineralisation of organic phosphorus impacts dissolved oxygen, DIC and ALK through stoichiometric ratios. Transformations of organic matter have an impact on alkalinity via NO$_{3}$ in a  -1:1 ratio. 

## Relevant Parameters
* $R_{C:P}$ - stoichiometric ratio of carbon to phosphorus (unitless): `bgc_pars.red_P_to_C` 
* $R_{O:P}$ - stoichiometric ratio of oxygen to phosphorus (unitless): `bgc_pars.red_P_to_O`
* $R_{N:P}$ - stoichiometric ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus (unitless): `bgc_pars.red_P_to_N`
